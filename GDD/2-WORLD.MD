## 3. Appendix: Major Historical Events

### 3.1. The Year of the Frozen Moon (30 AW)
The Year of the Frozen Moon (30 AW) was a period of unprecedented hardship in The Whispers when an unnatural winter descended upon the region, testing the resilience of its people and giving rise to the legend of the "Sons and Daughters of the Moon." This event would forever change the spiritual landscape of The Whispers and cement the Moon's Creed as the dominant faith in the region.

Amidst the bitter frost and growing hopelessness, a priest named Elias emerged as a beacon of light in Nightfall's darkest hour. A devout follower of the Moon's Creed, Elias traveled tirelessly through the frozen streets, tending to the sick, distributing what little food remained, and offering words of comfort. Miraculously, he uncovered hidden stores of food, seemingly appeared where aid was most needed, and brought warmth to the hearts of the suffering. His unwavering faith and compassion inspired the people to endure. Rumors spread that Elias was no mere man, but a "Son of the Moon," a prophesied figure sent to guide Nightfall through its most desperate times.

When the ice finally thawed and warmth returned to The Whispers, Nightfall emerged battered but not broken. The tales of Elias's miracles and selflessness spread far and wide, solidifying the belief in the "Sons and Daughters of the Moon."

**Other Children of the Moon:**
- **Vespera, the Port's Light (411 AW):** In 411 AW, the port city of Embris was ravaged by a deadly plague. Vespera, an alchemist, tirelessly worked to find a cure. Drawing upon her knowledge of rare herbs and alchemical processes, she synthesized a potent antidote and distributed it, saving countless lives and solidifying her place as a "Daughter of the Moon."
- **Leo, the Lighthouse's Flame (569 AW):** The original caretaker of the Driftwatch Orphanage. During a devastating wildfire, Leo refused to abandon the children under his care. He braved the inferno, guiding seven children to safety, sacrificing his own life when the burning roof collapsed upon him. He was honored as a "Son of the Moon," and the orphanage was rebuilt and renamed "Leo's Lighthouse" in his honor.

### 3.2. The Pearl War (367 AW)
The Pearl War (367 AW) was a defining conflict in the history of the Pearl Islands—now known as the Mermaid Islands—that reshaped the very foundation of House Lirs and established a matriarchal rule that would influence the region's culture for centuries. Sparked by the untimely death of Lord Isandro Lirs, the patriarch of the house, the war saw a brutal struggle for power between his two children: Lady Barbara Lirs, a seasoned naval commander, and her younger brother, Lord Craster Lirs, a politically favored but inexperienced leader.

At its core, the Pearl War was a conflict of identity, tradition, and ambition. The islands, named for their abundant pearl trade, had long balanced commerce and seafaring warfare. However, the death of Isandro, a respected yet aging leader, exposed a growing fracture in the islands' society—between those who sought to maintain the patriarchal customs of old and those who believed in the rising influence of women in warfare and leadership. The war for the Throne of Pearls had ended, but the repercussions of the conflict would echo through the Pearl Islands for generations. Barbara's victory not only marked the rise of House Lirs as a matriarchal power but also reshaped the cultural and political landscape of the islands, inspiring other coastal powers to embrace women as warriors, captains, and leaders.

### 3.3. The Great Maw Hunt (684 AW)
The Great Maw Hunt of 684 AW was a doomed expedition into the depths of the Murkwater Swamps led by Gregor Valtara, sixth son of Lord Brandon Valtara. Seeking glory and a legacy of his own, Gregor assembled a team of nine elite falconers from House Valtara to hunt the legendary beast known as the Great Maw—a creature that had become the subject of terrifying tales throughout The Whispers.

The expedition ended in tragedy, with only one survivor returning, his mind shattered by what he had witnessed. The fate of Gregor and his men remains one of the most chilling mysteries of The Whispers, and the failed hunt has since become a cautionary tale about the dangers that lurk in the Murkwater Swamps.

### 3.4. Odran's Rebellion (730 AW)
Odran's Rebellion (730 AW) was a significant armed conflict in The Whispers region, where several southern noble houses led by House Odran attempted to secede from the rule of House Seryn. The rebellion was ultimately crushed by King Arthur Seryn, known as the "Sword of Tomorrow," resulting in the complete extinction of Houses Odran and Cramb.

The conflict marked a pivotal moment in the history of The Whispers, reshaping the political landscape and demonstrating the military might and strategic brilliance of House Seryn. The rebellion unfolded in three major phases: the downfall of House Cramb, the twin offensive (comprising the Strigora Campaign and the Siege of Nightfall), and the final confrontation at Embris.

### 3.5. The Blood Auction Massacre (758 AW)
The Blood Auction Massacre (758 AW) stands as one of the most mysterious and disturbing events in the recent history of The Whispers. What began as a clandestine gathering of the Shadow Syndicate—a powerful criminal organization—ended in bloodshed and chaos, sending ripples through both the underworld and noble society alike.

The massacre occurred in secret chambers beneath the rebuilt city of Embris, where the Shadow Syndicate had organized one of their most exclusive underground markets—the Blood Auction. By dawn, over thirty attendees lay dead, including Martin Olaris, a prominent noble from House Olaris, and most of the valuable items had vanished along with the mysterious attackers. The event exposed the deep connections between the criminal underworld and noble society, while also revealing that even the most secretive and powerful organizations in The Whispers were vulnerable.
