# Divine Fantasy: Whispers

"Divine Fantasy: Whispers" is a UI-based, single-player RPG that strategically blends core mechanics from three distinct genres:

- **Sims-Style Social Simulation:** Deep NPC interaction, relationship management, and personal stat development.
- **RuneScape-Style Skilling:** A comprehensive system of non-combat and combat skills (e.g., woodcutting, blacksmithing, etc.) that form a core progression loop.
- **Mount & Blade-Style Strategy:** A high-level strategic layer involving army management, companion recruitment, and territory control.

This repository contains the Game Design Document (GDD) for the game.
